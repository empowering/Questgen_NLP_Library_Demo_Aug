For utility-scale and larger off-grid projects, ENGIE is focusing on establishing activities in a relatively small group of countries with conducive operational frameworks, rather than spreading itself more thinly across many markets where it may be more difficult to get projects done. This strategy has allowed ENGIE to expand its off-grid business for communities and individuals, building on pioneering projects in Uganda and Tanzania with operations in Mozambique, Kenya, Rwanda, Zambia, Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, and Nigeria.'}]}\n",
